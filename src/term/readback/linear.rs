//! Linear readback, directly from interaction combinator trees.
//!
//! ## The Algorithm
//!
//! To explain the algorithm, let's look at a simple case, the interaction net
//! `((123 x) x)`:
//!
//! ```text
//!        |   ((123 x) x)
//!       / \
//!      /   \ <---- node 0
//!     /_____\
//!      |   |
//!     /    |
//!    |     |
//!   / \    |
//!  /   \ <-|------ node 1
//! /_____\  |
//!  |   |   |
//! 123  |   |
//!       \_/
//!        x
//! ```
//!
//! This corresponds to the term `@f (f 123)`.
//!
//! Note that:
//! - node 0 and node 1 are both CON nodes, but node 0 is a lambda node whilst
//!   node 1 is an application node
//! - in the net, node 1 is the left child of node 0, but in the term, it is the
//!   right child
//!
//! Because of how the nodes are stored, when traversing the net, we can only
//! enter nodes through their principal ports (from tree parent to child).
//!
//! Thus, to read the net back properly, we need to be able to:
//! 1. distinguish between applications and lambdas
//! 2. communicate terms across wires
//!
//! Let's look at these one at a time.
//!
//! ### Distinguishing lambdas and applications
//!
//! To distinguishing lambdas and applications, we need to determine the
//! *polarity* of each port in the net. The polarity of a port is either `+` or
//! `-`, and `+` ports can only be connected to `-` ports (and vice versa).
//!
//! Semantically, positive ports represent the creation of a value, and negative
//! ports represent the destruction of a value. (Though this is an arbitrary
//! choice.)
//!
//! For this interaction system, there are a few more rules for polarity:
//! - the polarity of a free port is always `-`
//! - the polarity of the ports of a CON node is either `+(+ -)` or `-(- +)`
//!   (that is, port 0 and port 1 have the same polarity, and port 2 has the
//!   opposite)
//!
//! Using this information, we can completely label the above diagram with a
//! simple top-down recursive pass:
//!
//! ```text
//!        -
//!        |
//!        +
//!       / \
//!      /   \ <---- node 0
//!     /_____\
//!      +   -
//!     /    |
//!    -     |
//!   / \    |
//!  /   \ <-|------ node 1
//! /_____\  |
//!  -   +   |
//!  |   |   |
//!  +   |   |
//! 123  |   |
//!       \_/
//!        x
//! ```
//!
//! In fact, in general, if you know the polarity of one port of a tree, you can
//! trivially determine the polarity of every other port.
//!
//! The difficulty, then, comes when we're reading interaction nets with active
//! pairs:
//!
//! ```text
//!                    redex 0
//!              /--------'--------\
//!   tree 0      tree 1    tree 2
//! /----'----\   /--'--\   /--'--\
//!        |           _______      ((a b) b)
//!        |          /       \     & (c c) ~ (123 a)
//!        |         |         |
//!       / \       / \       / \
//!      /   \     /   \     /   \
//!     /_____\   /_____\   /_____\
//!      |   |     |   |     |   |
//!     /    |      \_/     123  |
//!    |     |       c           |
//!   / \    |                   |
//!  /   \   |                   |
//! /_____\  |                   |
//!  |   |   |                   |
//!  |    \_/                    |
//!  |     b                     |
//!   \_________________________/
//!                a
//! ```
//!
//! If we were to simply iterate over the trees here, we would run into a
//! problem at tree 1 -- we have no way of knowing the polarity of any of its
//! ports. We would have to first label tree 0, then tree 2, before being able
//! to label tree 1.
//!
//! Thus, when computing the polarities, we support propagating polarity
//! *variables*. Specifically, we create a polarity variable for each active
//! pair, and then traverse the tree, performing a process of polarity
//! inference/unification.
//!
//! For example:
//!
//! Start by labelling tree 0, since we know the polarity of the free port:
//! ```text
//!        -           _______      ((a b) b)
//!        |          /       \     & (c c) ~ (123 a)
//!        +         |         |
//!       / \       / \       / \
//!      /   \     /   \     /   \
//!     /_____\   /_____\   /_____\
//!      +   -     |   |     |   |
//!     /    |      \_/     123  |
//!    -     |       c           |
//!   / \    |                   |
//!  /   \   |                   |
//! /_____\  |                   |
//!  -   +   |                   |
//!  |    \_/                    |
//!  |     b                     |
//!   \_________________________/
//!                a
//! ```
//!
//! Introduce the polarity variable `p`, and label tree 1 (P is the opposite
//! polarity of p):
//! ```text
//!        -           _______      ((a b) b)
//!        |          /       \     & (c c) ~ (123 a)
//!        +         p         |
//!       / \       / \       / \
//!      /   \     /   \     /   \
//!     /_____\   /_____\   /_____\
//!      +   -     p   P     |   |
//!     /    |      \_/     123  |
//!    -     |       c           |
//!   / \    |                   |
//!  /   \   |                   |
//! /_____\  |                   |
//!  -   +   |                   |
//!  |    \_/                    |
//!  |     b                     |
//!   \_________________________/
//!                a
//!
//! Now label tree 2:
//! ```text
//!        -           _______      ((a b) b)
//!        |          /       \     & (c c) ~ (123 a)
//!        +         p         P
//!       / \       / \       / \
//!      /   \     /   \     /   \
//!     /_____\   /_____\   /_____\
//!      +   -     p   P     P   p
//!     /    |      \_/      |   |
//!    -     |       c       p   |
//!   / \    |              123  |
//!  /   \   |                   |
//! /_____\  |                   |
//!  -   +   |                   |
//!  |    \_/                    |
//!  |     b                     |
//!   \_________________________/
//!                a
//! ```
//!
//! Note that we now have a connection between a `-` port and a `p` port. This
//! means that `p = +`, so we can update our graph:
//! ```text
//!        -           _______      ((a b) b)
//!        |          /       \     & (c c) ~ (123 a)
//!        +         +         -
//!       / \       / \       / \
//!      /   \     /   \     /   \
//!     /_____\   /_____\   /_____\
//!      +   -     +   -     -   +
//!     /    |      \_/      |   |
//!    -     |       c       +   |
//!   / \    |              123  |
//!  /   \   |                   |
//! /_____\  |                   |
//!  -   +   |                   |
//!  |    \_/                    |
//!  |     b                     |
//!   \_________________________/
//!                a
//! ```
//!
//! And now our graph is fully labeled.
//!
//! When the net is fully connected, this algorithm can successfully label all
//! of the ports of the net.
//!
//! When there are disconnected subnets, however, there may be multiple valid
//! solutions; in these cases, the readback algorithm simply ignores the
//! problematic subnets and issues a warning.
//!
//! In many cases, though, the polarity of disconnected subnets can be
//! determined, since our interaction system has nodes that can only be read
//! back as one polarity (e.g. reference nodes are always positive).
//!
//! # Communicating terms across wires
//!
//! Going back to our simpler example:
//!
//! ```text
//!        |   ((123 x) x)
//!       / \
//!      /   \ <---- node 0
//!     /_____\
//!      |   |
//!     /    |
//!    |     |
//!   / \    |
//!  /   \ <-|------ node 1
//! /_____\  |
//!  |   |   |
//! 123  |   |
//!       \_/
//!        x
//! ```
//!
//! Because node 1 is a child of node 0, yet the term for node 1 is a child of
//! the term for node 0, after we traverse node 1, we need some way to
//! communicate that term across the `x` wire to node 0.
//!
//! In this case, since it needs to be transferred "forwards", it's pretty clear
//! how one might do this: simply add `("x", term_1)` to a hashmap once we've
//! traversed node 0 and and then retrieve it when we traverse node 1.
//!
//! However, sometimes we need to be able to transfer terms "backwards" across
//! wires.
//!
//! Thus, we need to create a system where both terms and term *holes* can be
//! transferred. For this, we use the `loaned` crate, which supplies a
//! `LoanedMut<'t, Term>` type that can represent terms with holes.
//!
//! In particular, we will associate a `Target<'t>` with every part, where a
//! target can either one of:
//! - `LoanedMut<'t, Term>` (a term, `+`)
//! - `&'t mut Term` (a term hole, `-`)
//! - `LoanedMut<'t, Pattern>` (a pattern, `-`)
//! - `&'t mut Pattern` (a pattern hole, `+`)
//!
//! The targets associated with connected ports will be linked with
//! `Readback::link`:
//! - linking a term with a term hole or a pattern with a pattern hole simply
//!   fills the hole using `LoanedMut::place`
//! - linking a term with a pattern creates a `let pat = term` statement
//! - linking a term hole with a pattern hole fills each with a new variable
//!
//! For the above example, then:
//! - visit node 0
//!   - this is a lambda, so we create a term with two holes, `@?p ?t`, and
//!     label the ports thusly:
//!     - port 0: `@?p ?t` (`+`, term)
//!     - port 1: `?p` (`+`, pattern hole)
//!     - port 2: `?t` (`-`, term hole)
//!   - this is the root node, so `@?b ?t` is the root term
//!   - visit the left child, node 1 (with uplink `?a`)
//!     - this is an application:
//!       - port 0: `?u` (`-`, term hole)
//!       - port 1: `?v` (`-`, term hole)
//!       - port 2: `(?u ?v)` (`+`, term)
//!     - we link port 0, `?u`, up to `?p` (pattern hole)
//!       - these are both holes so we create a new variable, `a`, and fill them
//!         both with it
//!     - visit the left child, `123` (with uplink `?v`)
//!       - this is a number node:
//!         - port 0: `123`
//!       - we link port 0, `123`, up to `?v`
//!         - we simply fill the term hole `?v` with the term `123`
//!     - visit the right child, `x` (with uplink `(a ?v)`)
//!       - this is a variable; add ``("x", `(a 123)`)`` to the hashmap
//!       - we link port 0, `123`, up to `?v`
//!   - visit the right child, `x` (with uplink `?t`)
//!       - this is a variable; remove ``("x", `(a 123)`)`` from the hashmap
//!       - link `(a 123)` to `?t`
//!         - we simply fill the term hole `?t` with the term `(a 123)`
//! - we're finished, the root term is now `@a (a 123)`
