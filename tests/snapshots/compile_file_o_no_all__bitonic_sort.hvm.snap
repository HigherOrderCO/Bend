[1mThe following functions contain recursive cycles incompatible with HVM's strict evaluation:[0m
  * Down -> Flow -> Down
  * Warp -> Warp
  * Gen -> Gen
  * Rev -> Rev
  * Sort -> Sort
  and 1 other cycles...

The greedy eager evaluation of HVM may cause infinite loops.
[1mRefactor these functions to use lazy references instead of direct function calls.[0m
A reference is strict when it's being called ('(Foo x)') or when it's used non-linearly ('let x = Foo; (x x)').
It is lazy when it's an argument ('(x Foo)') or when it's used linearly ('let x = Foo; (x 0)').

[1mTry one of these strategies:[0m
- Use pattern matching with 'match', 'fold', and 'bend' to automatically lift expressions to lazy references.
- Replace direct calls with combinators. For example, change:
    'Foo = λa λb (b (λc (Foo a c)) a)'
  to:
    'Foo = λa λb (b (λc λa (Foo a c)) (λa a) a)'
  which is lifted to:
    'Foo = λa λb (b Foo__C1 Foo_C2 a)'
- Replace non-linear 'let' expressions with 'use' expressions. For example, change:
    'Foo = λf let x = Foo; (f x x)'
  to:
    'Foo = λf use x = Foo; (f x x)'
  which inlines to:
    'Foo = λf (f Foo Foo)'
- If disabled, re-enable the default 'float-combinators' and 'linearize-matches' compiler options.

To disable this check, use the "-Arecursion-cycle" compiler option.
